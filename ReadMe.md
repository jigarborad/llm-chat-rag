## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jigarborad/llm-chat-app.git
   cd llm-chat-app
   ```
2. **Create and activate the Virtual Environment:**

    Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and execute the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    conda create --name venv
    ```

    After creating the virtual environment, activate it using the appropriate command for your operating system:

    - **Windows:**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - **Unix or MacOS:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

        or 

    - **conda:**
        ```bash
        conda activate venv
        ```


    Once activated, you should see `(venv)` prefixed before your command prompt. This indicates that you are now operating within the virtual environment.
